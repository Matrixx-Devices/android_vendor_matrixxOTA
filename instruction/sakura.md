## Before Starting Flashing

- Backup all your data to an external source.
- Keep in mind that a clean flash is always recommended when coming from another ROM.
- **Clean flash involves formatting data**, which means all internal storage data will be lost. SD Card data should remain unaffected. Back up important files beforehand.
